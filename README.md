# tribute-page
This is a project from freecodecamp. I created a simple tribute page for Jose Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines.

Used HTML and CSS only (no libraries and such)
Made it dark themed so that it is easy to the eyes.
Made it as responsive as possible

Why Jose Rizal?

I chose him because he helped my country (Philippines) a lot. Without him and his contributions and novels, who knows what would've happened. He also inspired me to keep on doing what is right and to love my country.

I also thought that there are probably so many tribute pages about other people (Elon musk...) and I wanted others to know about him.
